## Rejesha – Web Security Learning Project

While building **Rejesha**, I gained a deeper respect for the tech community — debugging, troubleshooting, and hardening a web app taught me that every line of code is a lesson.

**Tech Stack & Features:**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** PHP with secure coding practices  
- **Database:** MariaDB  
- **Security Highlights:**
  - Input validation & sanitization  
  - SQL injection prevention via prepared statements  
  - Basic XSS defense  
  - Duplicate email prevention  

**Visuals:**
